# Ayurveda Prakriti App (Frontend)

This repository contains a single-page React application (Create React App) for a small Ayurveda health demo. It implements:

- User registration and login (client-side, localStorage-based session)
- Prakriti (Vata/Pitta/Kapha) quiz and analysis
- Personalized Diet recommendations and editable diet plan
- Daily Schedule editor
- Follow-ups / reminders list
- Admin panel to view users and toggle premium access

This is a demo frontend that stores all data in `localStorage` for simplicity. It is intended as a teaching / prototype project and can be wired to a backend later.

## Repo layout

- `frontend/` — React app (CRA)
  - `src/components/` — React components (Dashboard, Login, Register, UserProfile, PrakritiQuiz, DietChart, DailySchedule, FollowUps, AdminPanel)
  - `src/data/prakritiQuestions.js` — quiz questions
  - `public/` — static HTML and manifest

## Key conventions

- Storage keys in `localStorage`:
  - `users` — an array of user objects (id, name, email, password, premium, prakriti, diet, schedule, followUps)
  - `user` — the current session user (a copy of an entry from `users`)

- Components use React hooks (functional components with `useState`, `useEffect`, `useNavigate`).
- Styling uses inline JS style objects and small scoped `<style>` blocks in components.

## Features

- Register creates a `user` object and appends to `users`.
- Login looks up the `users` array and sets the session `user`.
- Prakriti quiz tallies answers, writes `prakriti` into the session user and `users`, and pre-populates diet suggestions.
- Diet page shows personalized recommendations and allows adding custom items.
- Schedule page stores a multi-line routine.
- Follow-ups is a simple todo-list stored in the user's `followUps`.
- Admin panel lists users, allows viewing details (JSON), granting/revoking premium, and deleting users.

## Run locally (Windows PowerShell)

Open a PowerShell terminal at the repo root and run:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000. The dev server supports hot-reload.

## Recommended git / GitHub workflow to upload this project

1. Create a new GitHub repository (you can do this on github.com or using `gh` CLI).

2. From the project root (where this README lives), run the following (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Initialize git if not already
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit — Ayurveda frontend"

# Create remote repo using GitHub CLI (optional). Requires `gh auth login` beforehand.
gh repo create <your-username>/<repo-name> --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# OR, if you already created the repo on GitHub, add remote and push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Notes:
- If you prefer HTTPS, use the `https://github.com/...` remote. For SSH, use the `git@github.com:...` form.
- The `gh repo create` step automates repo creation and pushing if you have the GitHub CLI configured.

## Security & audit

- After `npm install` you may see `npm audit` warnings. Run `npm audit` to view details and `npm audit fix` to attempt non-breaking fixes. `npm audit fix --force` can install breaking changes and should be used with care.

## Next steps / Suggestions

- Replace `localStorage` with a small API adapter (`services/api.js`) so components can switch between demo/local and real backend easily.
- Add unit tests for components (React Testing Library is available via CRA deps).
- Improve responsive styling and accessibility; consider extracting common UI primitives (Button, Card) to `src/components/ui/`.

## Troubleshooting

- If you get build errors after adding dependencies, run `npm install` again and check the terminal for ESM/CJS import errors. Some packages (notably `uuid` v9) are ESM-only — CRA may require v8 or enabling ESM support.

## Contact / help

If you want me to push the code to GitHub for you, provide one of the following and I will run the push steps:

- A repo URL you already created and want me to push to; or
- Permission to run `gh repo create <your-username>/<repo-name>` (you must have `gh` authenticated in this machine).

If you prefer to push yourself, follow the commands above. After pushing, share the repo URL and I can open a PR to add CI or a deployment workflow.
